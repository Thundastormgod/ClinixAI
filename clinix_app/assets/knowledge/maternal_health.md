# Maternal and Child Health Guidelines

## Antenatal Care (ANC)

### Recommended ANC Visit Schedule
| Visit | Timing | Key Actions |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | Before 12 weeks | Confirm pregnancy, baseline tests, folic acid |
| 2 | 20 weeks | Anomaly scan if available, tetanus vaccine |
| 3 | 26 weeks | Blood pressure, proteinuria check |
| 4 | 30 weeks | Fetal position, growth assessment |
| 5 | 34 weeks | Birth plan, danger sign review |
| 6 | 36 weeks | Presentation check |
| 7 | 38 weeks | Engagement, readiness for labor |
| 8 | 40 weeks | Post-dates assessment |

### Essential ANC Components
1. **History**: Past pregnancies, medical conditions, family history
2. **Examination**: Blood pressure, weight, fundal height, fetal heart
3. **Investigations**: HIV, syphilis, hemoglobin, blood group, urinalysis
4. **Interventions**: Iron/folic acid, tetanus vaccine, IPTp for malaria
5. **Counseling**: Nutrition, danger signs, birth preparedness

### Danger Signs in Pregnancy - SEEK CARE IMMEDIATELY

#### First Trimester (Weeks 1-12)
- Severe vomiting (unable to keep anything down)
- Heavy vaginal bleeding
- Severe lower abdominal pain
- Fever

#### Second Trimester (Weeks 13-27)
- Vaginal bleeding
- Severe headache with blurred vision
- Reduced fetal movement (after 20 weeks)
- Leaking fluid from vagina

#### Third Trimester (Weeks 28-40)
- **Vaginal bleeding** - May indicate placenta previa or abruption
- **Severe headache with visual disturbance** - Pre-eclampsia
- **Swelling of face and hands** - Pre-eclampsia
- **Convulsions** - Eclampsia (EMERGENCY)
- **Reduced fetal movement** - Fetal distress
- **Fever** - Infection
- **Water breaking before 37 weeks** - Preterm labor
- **Regular painful contractions before 37 weeks** - Preterm labor

### Pre-eclampsia and Eclampsia

#### Risk Factors
- First pregnancy
- Previous pre-eclampsia
- Multiple pregnancy (twins)
- Obesity
- Age >40 or <18
- Family history
- Pre-existing hypertension or kidney disease

#### Warning Signs
- Blood pressure ≥140/90 mmHg
- Protein in urine
- Severe headache
- Visual disturbances (flashing lights, blurred vision)
- Upper abdominal pain (liver involvement)
- Swelling of face and hands
- Reduced urine output

#### Management
- Refer urgently if BP ≥160/110 or symptoms present
- Magnesium sulfate for seizure prevention
- Delivery is the only cure
- Monitor mother and baby closely

## Labor and Delivery

### Signs of True Labor
- Regular contractions increasing in frequency and intensity
- Cervical dilation and effacement
- "Show" - blood-stained mucus
- Rupture of membranes may occur

### Stages of Labor

#### First Stage (Cervix dilates 0-10cm)
- **Latent phase**: 0-4cm, may last many hours
- **Active phase**: 4-10cm, typically 1cm/hour
- Monitor: Contractions, fetal heart rate, maternal vital signs

#### Second Stage (Baby delivered)
- From full dilation to delivery
- Duration: Usually <2 hours (primip), <1 hour (multip)
- Active pushing with contractions

#### Third Stage (Placenta delivered)
- Active management recommended:
  - Oxytocin after delivery of baby
  - Controlled cord traction
  - Uterine massage

### Danger Signs During Labor
- Prolonged labor (>12 hours active phase)
- Abnormal fetal heart rate (<100 or >180)
- Heavy bleeding before delivery
- Cord prolapse
- Maternal exhaustion or distress
- Fever
- Foul-smelling discharge

### Newborn Care - Essential Actions

#### Immediate Care (First Hour)
1. **Dry and stimulate** - Dry baby, remove wet cloth
2. **Assess breathing** - Should cry within 1 minute
3. **Keep warm** - Skin-to-skin contact
4. **Delay cord clamping** - 1-3 minutes after birth
5. **Early breastfeeding** - Within first hour

#### APGAR Score (1 and 5 minutes)
| Criterion | 0 | 1 | 2 |
|-----------|---|---|---|
| Heart rate | Absent | <100 | ≥100 |
| Breathing | Absent | Slow/irregular | Good/crying |
| Muscle tone | Limp | Some flexion | Active |
| Reflex | None | Grimace | Cry |
| Color | Blue/pale | Pink body, blue extremities | Pink |

- Score 7-10: Normal
- Score 4-6: Needs assistance
- Score <4: Needs resuscitation

## Postnatal Care

### Maternal Postnatal Visits
| Visit | Timing | Focus |
|-------|--------|-------|
| 1 | 24-48 hours | Bleeding, infection signs, breastfeeding |
| 2 | Day 3-7 | Mood, breast engorgement, lochia |
| 3 | Week 6 | Recovery, contraception, cervical check |

### Postnatal Danger Signs (Mother)
- Heavy bleeding (soaking >1 pad/hour)
- Fever >38°C
- Foul-smelling vaginal discharge
- Severe headache with visual changes
- Severe abdominal pain
- Difficulty breathing
- Calf pain and swelling (DVT)
- Signs of depression or psychosis

### Newborn Danger Signs
- **Not feeding well** or refusing to feed
- **Convulsions**
- **Fast breathing** (>60/min)
- **Severe chest indrawing**
- **No movement or very weak**
- **Fever** (>37.5°C) or **hypothermia** (<35.5°C)
- **Umbilical redness or pus**
- **Jaundice** in first 24 hours or severe jaundice
- **Bleeding from any site**

## Breastfeeding

### Benefits
- Complete nutrition for first 6 months
- Antibodies protect against infection
- Promotes bonding
- Reduces maternal bleeding
- Contraceptive effect (LAM)

### Good Attachment Signs
- Mouth wide open
- Lower lip turned out
- More areola visible above than below lip
- Chin touching breast
- Slow deep sucks with swallowing

### Common Problems
1. **Sore nipples**: Usually due to poor attachment
2. **Engorgement**: Frequent feeding, warm compress
3. **Mastitis**: Continue feeding, antibiotics if needed
4. **Low milk supply**: Feed more frequently, ensure good attachment

### When NOT to Breastfeed
- Active untreated TB (until 2 weeks of treatment)
- HIV: Follow national guidelines (often ART + breastfeeding)
- Certain medications
- Infant galactosemia

## Child Health - First 5 Years

### Vaccination Schedule (WHO/African Recommended)
| Age | Vaccines |
|-----|----------|
| Birth | BCG, OPV-0, Hepatitis B |
| 6 weeks | DTP-HepB-Hib, OPV-1, PCV-1, Rotavirus-1 |
| 10 weeks | DTP-HepB-Hib, OPV-2, PCV-2, Rotavirus-2 |
| 14 weeks | DTP-HepB-Hib, OPV-3, PCV-3, IPV |
| 6 months | Vitamin A |
| 9 months | Measles-1, Yellow Fever |
| 12 months | Vitamin A |
| 15-18 months | Measles-2, DTP booster |

### Growth Monitoring - Warning Signs
- Weight loss or failure to gain weight
- Falling across growth chart percentiles
- MUAC <125mm (moderate malnutrition)
- MUAC <115mm (severe malnutrition)
- Bilateral pitting edema (kwashiorkor)

### Malnutrition Management
#### Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM)
- MUAC <115mm OR weight-for-height <-3 Z-score OR bilateral edema
- **With complications**: Inpatient treatment (F-75 then F-100)
- **Without complications**: Outpatient RUTF (Ready-to-Use Therapeutic Food)

#### Moderate Acute Malnutrition (MAM)
- MUAC 115-125mm OR weight-for-height -3 to -2 Z-score
- Supplementary feeding program
- Nutrition counseling

## IMCI Key Messages

### Feeding Recommendations by Age
- 0-6 months: Exclusive breastfeeding
- 6-12 months: Breast milk + complementary foods 2-3 times daily
- 12-24 months: Breast milk + family foods 3-4 times daily
- >24 months: Family foods 4-5 times daily

### Signs of Illness Requiring Attention
- Not able to drink or breastfeed
- Vomiting everything
- Convulsions
- Lethargic or unconscious
- Chest indrawing
- Fast breathing (>60 if <2 months, >50 if 2-12 months, >40 if 1-5 years)
