# WHO Emergency Triage Assessment and Treatment (ETAT)

## Overview

The Emergency Triage Assessment and Treatment (ETAT) system is designed for rapid identification of children with life-threatening conditions who require immediate emergency treatment.

## ETAT Priority Signs - IMMEDIATE (Red Zone)

### Airway and Breathing
- **Obstructed breathing**: Stridor, severe indrawing, cyanosis
- **Severe respiratory distress**: Gasping, grunting, severe chest indrawing
- **Central cyanosis**: Blue tongue, blue lips
- **Apnea or very slow breathing**: Fewer than 20 breaths per minute in infants

### Circulation
- **Cold hands with capillary refill > 3 seconds**: Sign of shock
- **Weak, fast pulse**: Tachycardia with weak peripheral pulses
- **Severe dehydration**: Sunken eyes, skin pinch goes back very slowly (>2 seconds)

### Neurological
- **Unconscious or comatose**: AVPU scale shows "U" (unresponsive)
- **Convulsing now**: Active seizure
- **Severe lethargy**: Child cannot be roused

## Priority Signs - URGENT (Yellow Zone)

### Visible Priority Signs
- Any sick young infant (under 2 months)
- Temperature very high (>39°C) or hypothermia (<35.5°C)
- Trauma or other urgent surgical condition
- Severe pallor (severe anemia)
- Poisoning
- Severe pain
- Respiratory distress (not severe)
- Restless, continuously irritable, or lethargic
- Referral from another facility
- Malnutrition: visible severe wasting
- Edema of both feet

### History-Based Priority Signs
- Reported convulsions
- Reported diarrhea with dehydration
- Unable to breastfeed or drink

## Non-Urgent (Green Zone)

Children with none of the above signs can wait their turn for assessment.

## Triage Actions by Color

### RED - Emergency
1. Move child to resuscitation area IMMEDIATELY
2. Call for senior help
3. Begin emergency treatment:
   - Airway management
   - Oxygen if available
   - IV fluids for shock
   - Glucose for hypoglycemia
   - Anticonvulsants if seizing

### YELLOW - Priority
1. Move child to front of queue
2. Assess within 15 minutes
3. Start treatment while waiting if needed
4. Monitor for deterioration to RED

### GREEN - Queue
1. Normal queue
2. Routine assessment
3. Watch for changes in condition

## Danger Signs in Children

### Immediate Danger Signs
- Not able to drink or breastfeed
- Vomiting everything
- Convulsions
- Lethargic or unconscious
- Chest indrawing
- Stridor in calm child

### Signs of Severe Dehydration
- Sunken eyes
- Very slow skin pinch return (>2 seconds)
- Unable to drink or drinking poorly
- Lethargy or unconsciousness

### Signs of Severe Malnutrition
- Visible severe wasting
- Bilateral pitting edema
- MUAC < 115mm (6-59 months)

## Special Considerations for Africa

### Common Emergency Presentations
1. **Severe Malaria**: Fever + altered consciousness, convulsions, severe anemia, or respiratory distress
2. **Severe Pneumonia**: Fast breathing + chest indrawing or danger signs
3. **Severe Diarrhea**: Watery diarrhea + severe dehydration or shock
4. **Severe Malnutrition**: Visible wasting + complications (infection, hypoglycemia, hypothermia)

### Resource-Limited Settings
- Prioritize low-cost, high-impact interventions
- Use clinical signs when lab tests unavailable
- MUAC tape for malnutrition screening
- Oral rehydration for dehydration when IV unavailable
- Artemether/lumefantrine for suspected malaria
